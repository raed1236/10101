# We should usually track the `p2pderivatives/feature/ln-dlc-channels[-10101]` branch.

# We are currently depending on one patch that will _not_ be merged into
# `p2pderivatives/rust-dlc#feature/ln-dlc-channels`: 4e104b4. This patch ensures backwards
# compatibility for 10101 through the `rust-lightning:0.0.116` upgrade. We will be able to drop it
# once all users have been upgraded and traded once.
